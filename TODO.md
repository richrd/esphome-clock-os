# TODO:
- [ ] Boot screen
- [ ] Add option to shows the clock after being idle for a while
- [X] Add display timeout setting
    - [ ] Does not work if a real time source isn't available / can't be synced
- [ ] Add rumble to alarm
- [ ] Make alarm tone selectable
- [ ] Add more clock faces and allow selecting the default
- [X] Pausing a game when rumble is active causes the rumble to stay on, can probably fix by adding a timer which cuts it off after e.g. 2 seconds, or when leaving an app
- [ ] Make the system easily configurable for end users
- [X] Stopwatch feature
- [ ] Rumble intensity setting (how long to rumble when triggered once)
    - This should help tune the intensity of rumble in games depending on the type of vibrator motor
- [ ] Game high scores
    - [ ] Requires adding a text input component
- [X] Fix default clock showing full signal when not connected (show empty bars and X instead)
    - [X] Similar info in System > Status screen
- [ ] Fix previous display page flashing when navigating to new page
